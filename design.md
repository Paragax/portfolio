Qs to ask in post:

AWS is a listed skill. But I technically don't know all of the niche AWS stuff that nobody uses. But I also don't want to spam a bunch of AWS services.
Thoughts? -- Make it clickable with an arrow, it can expand all of the specific techs I use
Should I be putting education down? Have two degrees: Bachelors in CS, Bachelor of Fine Arts.
My current "call to action" is just a link to my resume with a redacted phone number. Is that fine?

How can I show off this resume pipeline project, with users?
